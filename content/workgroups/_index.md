CHIPS Alliance will be adding Projects over time as the community gets started and may spin up or wind down Workgroups as needed to reflect our work across the SoC and tooling ecosystem. We welcome code, engineer involvement and partnership collaborations to further define and focus projects into relevant and strategically critical opportunities. Members and non-members alike are invited to participate in our work to change the landscape of chip development to be more open source. Please join the [technical-discuss mailing list](https://lists.chipsalliance.org/g/technical-discuss) to get started!
