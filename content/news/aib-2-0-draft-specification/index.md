*AIB reduces design barriers, costs, and leverages generators to ease development of  chiplet-based designs*

**SAN FRANCISCO, July 16, 2020** – CHIPS Alliance, the leading consortium advancing common and open hardware for interfaces, processors and systems, today announced that it has released the Advanced Interface Bus (AIB) version 2.0 draft specification on [GitHub](https://github.com/chipsalliance/AIB-specification). The AIB standard is an open-source, royalty-free PHY-level standard for connecting multiple semiconductor die within the same package. AIB is ideal for designing SoCs, FPGAs, SerDes chiplets, high-performance ADC/DAC chiplets, optical networking chiplets and more. 

AIB 2.0 has more than six times the edge bandwidth density of AIB 1.0 through increases in the per-wire line rate and the number of IOs per channel. Additionally, with smaller microbumps AIB 2.0 can use as little as half of the current microbump array area. AIB makes it easier for designers to connect chiplets so companies can mix foundries, process nodes, IP sources, etc. for more flexibility in designing highly-integrated semiconductor devices. 

“The AIB 2.0 draft standard continues the CHIPS Alliance’s efforts to provide comprehensive design resources to simplify hardware design and reduce development costs,” said Dr. Zvonimir Bandić, Chairman, CHIPS Alliance. “As companies increasingly rely on chiplets to keep up with the latest computing requirements and workloads for different applications, AIB will make it easier to integrate silicon IP with other chiplets into a single device to deliver new levels of functionality and optimization.”

The CHIPS Alliance and its members are working together to help foster the growth of an industry ecosystem which engenders more device innovation via heterogeneous integration. With broader adoption and support for AIB-enabled chiplets, developers can go beyond the limits of traditional monolithic semiconductor manufacturing to leverage the ideal process node for each function in their design while lowering development costs. The AIB specification is already in use by leading semiconductor companies, and has also been adopted by DARPA’s Common Heterogeneous Integration and IP Reuse Strategies (CHIPS) program.

To further reduce the design effort of producing block variants and porting custom blocks to a new process, Blue Cheetah Analog Design, Inc. has developed agile, process portable, and parameterizable generators for the AIB die-to-die interface. Blue Cheetah’s AIB PHY Generator enables the rapid generation of sign-off ready AIB custom blocks (i.e. netlist, GDS, LEF, LIB, and behavioral models) across a multitude of process design kits (PDKs).

“Reducing barriers to entry in developing custom silicon will be critical for the growth, adoption, and success of the chiplet movement,” said Dr. Krishna Settaluri, CEO, Blue Cheetah Analog Design. “By producing custom blocks at push-button speed, Blue Cheetah’s generators drastically reduce time-to-market and engineering effort required to produce tape-out ready IP. We are excited to offer this capability and look forward to enabling companies to thrive in the chiplet ecosystem.”

Dr. Settaluri of Blue Cheetah and David Kehlet of Intel® Corporation will be discussing the AIB PHY generator and AIB 2.0 draft specification at DAC 2020, which is being held virtually this year. The session, called “Tutorial 10 Part 1: Chiplet Integration: Tools, Methodology, Requirement, Infrastructure,” will take place on Monday, July 20 at 1:30 p.m. PT.
