One of the most recent projects developed within the workgroup is the [unified f4pga CLI tool](https://github.com/chipsalliance/f4pga). In the broader context of our [continuous efforts to make the FPGA space more unified and flexible](https://antmicro.com/blog/2021/09/fpga-interchange-format/), creating the f4pga CLI tool was a logical next step – it allowed us to wrap the underlying tools into a single CLI, making the F4PGA toolchain a more complete flow. The currently supported architectures are AMD’s (former Xilinx) 7 Series, Lattice’s iCE40 and QuickLogic’s EOS S3.
