*Xilinx to continue to drive forward open source FPGA innovation*

**SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 3, 2022** – CHIPS Alliance, the leading consortium advancing common and open hardware for interfaces, processors and systems, today announced that Xilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ: XLNX) has joined the CHIPS Alliance organization. Xilinx is a leader in adaptive computing, providing highly-flexible programmable silicon, enabled by a suite of advanced software and tools to drive rapid innovation across a wide span of industries and technologies – from consumer to cars to the cloud. 

“Xilinx has long been an advocate of open standards and open source,” said Tomas Evensen, CTO Open Source at Xilinx. “As a member of the CHIPS Alliance, we look forward to continuing to spearhead open FPGA initiatives to give everyone the opportunity to innovate faster and do more with their designs.”

Xilinx collaborated with longstanding CHIPS Alliance members Antmicro and Google to develop the [FPGA Interchange Format](https://fpga-interchange-schema.readthedocs.io/), which helps to lower design barriers by enabling interoperability between open and closed source FPGA toolchains. Xilinx designed its [RapidWright](https://github.com/Xilinx/RapidWright) open source platform to work with the Interchange Format. RapidWright enables users to customize implementations to their unique challenges and provides a design methodology using pre-implemented modules with a gateway to back-end tools in Vivado. 

“As the inventor of the FPGA, Xilinx is one of the key companies driving forward innovation in this market,” said Rob Mains, General Manager at CHIPS Alliance. “Xilinx has already been working closely with several CHIPS Alliance members around open source efforts, so it’s great to have them under the CHIPS Alliance umbrella as we plan to boost our FPGA efforts this year.”
