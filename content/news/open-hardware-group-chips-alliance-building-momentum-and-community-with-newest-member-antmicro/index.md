Antmicro Joins CHIPS Alliance to develop open source cores, IP blocks and tools for CPUs, RISC-V-based SoCs and peripherals

**SAN FRANCISCO –  April 18, 2019** – CHIPS Alliance, the leading consortium advancing common, open hardware for interfaces, processors and systems, today announced Antmicro is joining the organization. Antmicro is a software-driven technology company focused on introducing open source into strategic areas of industry, especially edge AI. [Announced just last month](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/2019/03/linux-foundation-to-host-chips-alliance-project-to-propel-industry-innovation-through-open-source-cpu-chip-and-soc-design/), the CHIPS Alliance welcomes Antmicro among its initial members Esperanto Technologies, Google, SiFive, and Western Digital.

CHIPS Alliance is a project hosted by [the Linux Foundation](http://linuxfoundation.org/) to foster a collaborative environment to accelerate the creation and deployment of more efficient and flexible CPUs, SoCs, and peripherals for use in mobile, computing, consumer electronics, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. [The CHIPS Alliance](https://chipsalliance.org/) project hosts and curates high-quality open source Register Transfer Level (RTL) code relevant to the design of open source CPUs, RISC-V-based SoCs, and complex peripherals for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and custom silicon. Members are committed to both open source hardware and continued momentum behind the free and open RISC-V architecture.

“The [RISC-V Foundation](https://riscv.org/) directs the standards and promotes the adoption of the open and free Instruction Set Architecture. This enables organizations to innovate for the next generation of hardware development. CHIPS Alliance is a natural extension for companies and universities who want to collaborate and create RTL based on RISC-V and related peripherals,” said Calista Redmond, CEO of the RISC-V Foundation.

“Antmicro believes in open source collaboration around portable, extendible and vendor-neutral technologies, which we consider a strong foundation for transparent, shared development processes based on good practices. We’re joining CHIPS Alliance because it is the conduit through which we can all realize the vision of open source RTL designs for silicon and FPGAs,” said Peter Gielda, CEO of Antmicro.

The CHIPS Alliance community includes technology developers and contributors supported by a Board of Directors and a Technical Steering Committee. Its initial plans focus on establishing a curation process aimed at providing the FPGA and chip community access to high-quality, enterprise grade hardware.
