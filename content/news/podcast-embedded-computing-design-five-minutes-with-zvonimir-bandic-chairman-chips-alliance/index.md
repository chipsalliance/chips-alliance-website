Zvonimir Bandic wears lots of hats. He is the Senior Director of Hardware Platforms for [Western Digital](https://www.westerndigital.com/); he’s a Member of the Board of Directors for the [RISC-V Foundation](https://riscv.org/), and he’s the Chairman of the [Chips Alliance](https://chipsalliance.org/). It’s that latter capacity that we discussed in this week’s Five Minutes With…discussion. The organization focuses on things like open source hardware, software tools, RTL development, and related topics. They will be holding their [inaugural workshop](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/chips-alliance-workshop-2019/) in just a few weeks, so it was timely to understand the purpose of the Alliance. And now I do, as will you.
