*Mentor to present at the virtual CHIPS Alliance Workshop on Sept. 17* 

**SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 18, 2020** – CHIPS Alliance, the leading consortium advancing common and open hardware for interfaces, processors and systems, today announced that Mentor, a Siemens business, has joined as its newest member. The CHIPS Alliance has a roster of more than 20 members collaborating to accelerate the creation and deployment of open system-on-chips (SoCs), peripherals and software tools for a wide range of applications.

“Mentor has a long history of supporting open standards to enable companies to design and verify their solutions,” said Badru Agarwala, general manager of Digital Design and Implementation Solutions at Mentor. “High level synthesis plays an important role in the design of accelerators, and in fostering an open and collaborative hardware development ecosystem. We look forward to contributing to the CHIPS Alliance’s efforts to reduce design barriers for the benefit of the entire silicon ecosystem.”

Mentor is a world leader in electronic hardware and software design solutions, providing products, consulting services and award-winning support for the world’s most successful electronic, semiconductor and systems companies. The company recently [collaborated](https://www.imperas.com/articles/imperas-collaborates-with-mentor-on-risc-v-core-rtl-coverage-driven-design-verification) with another CHIPS Alliance member, Imperas Software, to extend the hardware design verification of RISC-V cores with industrial quality coverage methodologies. Mentor’s high level synthesis (HLS) tool, Catapult, enables hardware designers to use C++ or SystemC to describe functional intent and move up to a more productive abstraction level.

 “Over the past year we’ve focused on expanding our membership base and achieving new technical milestones as we work to make open source silicon a reality for mobile, computing, consumer electronics and Internet of Things applications,” said Dr. Zvonimir Bandić, Chairman, CHIPS Alliance. “We’re pleased to welcome Mentor to this dynamic, collaborative community driving the new era of hardware innovation.” 

Mentor will be presenting at the CHIPS Alliance Workshop, being held virtually on Thursday, Sept. 17. Mentor’s Anoop Saha will be presenting the session “Open ML Accelerator.”
