CHIPS Alliance’s general manager Rob Mains joined Amelia Dalton at EE Journal’s FishFry podcast for a lively discussion about how we’re working to make chip design more accessible. Rob discussed CHIPS Alliance’s work with RISC-V International to develop a new [unified memory standard](https://chipsalliance.org/news/risc-v-international-omnixtend-working-group/), along with our work to accelerate the design of open source chipsets with the [AIB 2.0 specification](https://chipsalliance.org/news/aib-2-0-draft-specification/). The conversation also touched on our efforts to provide better support for SystemVerilog using open source tools and to create a dynamic stratified scheduler implementation in Verilator.
