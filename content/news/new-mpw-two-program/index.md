CHIPS Alliance is excited to announce that the hardware development community can submit their open source design projects to Efabless.com for space on their forthcoming shuttle. This opportunity comes after the success of having 40 submissions for the MPW-ONE shuttle; 60% of those designs were submitted by first-time ASIC designers. [MPW-TWO](https://efabless.com/open_shuttle_program/2) is the second Open MPW Shuttle providing fabrication for fully open-source projects using the SkyWater Open Source PDK announced by Google and SkyWater. 

The shuttle gives designers the freedom to innovate without having to worry about the risks associated with the cost of fabrication. This is a great opportunity for individuals, universities, and industry to create their own IP and have it manufactured. 

The deadline for submission is June 18. Submissions must be open source designs and leverage open source tooling such as OpenROAD, OpenLane and other EDA applications that Efabless.com has at its design portal. Read more about the project requirements and submit here: https://efabless.com/open_shuttle_program/2.

I look forward to seeing the communityâ€™s contributions for this generous offering from Efabless.com and Google.
