CHIPS Alliance will be onsite at [OCP Global Summit 2025](https://www.opencompute.org/summit/global-summit), which takes place on Monday, October 13-Thursday, October 16 at the San Jose Convention Center! We’re excited about this year’s program, which features several talks about [Caliptra](https://www.chipsalliance.org/news/chips-alliance-welcomes-the-caliptra-open-source-root-of-trust-project/), the open source Root-of-Trust (RoT) project highlighting its roadmap, security enhancements, cryptographic core, and integration into real-world cloud and platform environments.  

Check out the sessions on Thursday, October 16 and them to your calendar here:  

**From Flashless to Fearless: A Rust Firmware Journey into Caliptra Streaming Boot**  
**Thu, Oct 16, 8:50 am – 9:05 am | Concourse Level – 211**  
Vishal Soni and Xiling Sun from Microsoft present a deep dive into Caliptra’s flashless, streaming boot. They’ll show how Rust and TockOS power the firmware stack and share lessons from building memory-safe firmware for secure embedded systems.

**Caliptra Subsystem Manufacturing & Production Debug Flows**  
**Thu, Oct 16, 1:15 pm – 1:30 pm | Concourse Level – 211**  
John Thomson (lowRISC), Miguel Osorio (Google), and Vishal Mhatre (Microsoft) present Caliptra’s Lifecycle Controller and Fuse Controller, enhanced from OpenTitan RTL to securely manage lifecycle states and enable robust production debug. They’ll show how secure transitions, token injection, and multi-level debug policies strengthen lifecycle management in future open silicon Root-of-Trust systems.
