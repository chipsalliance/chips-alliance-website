CHIPS Alliance was founded in March 2019 to design high-quality, open source hardware register transfer level (RTL) and develop open source hardware and software design tools. By creating an open and collaborative environment, companies and organizations can develop innovative, cost effective hardware designs optimized for the requirements of today’s silicon devices and FPGAs.

CHIPS Alliance was incorporated by four organizations which wanted to make open source silicon a reality. Esperanto, Google, SiFive and Western Digital were the founding members. Now almost two years later, it is fitting to look back at our progress. We are pleased to present this annual report detailing the many things we have accomplished collectively in this fast growing organization.

Comments and feedback are welcome at info@chipsalliance.org.

> “The growth behind CHIPS Alliance has been incredible. We are laying the foundation for open source hardware development to become accessible to a wider number of companies, universities and individuals.”
> 
> – **Zvonimir Bandic**, Governing Board Chair, CHIPS Alliance, and Senior Director, Western Digital

## Who We Are

CHIPS Alliance is a barrier free, open organization focused on developing open source hardware RTL and open source hardware and software development tools. The organization desires to lower the cost of chip development through collaboration, leveraging the diverse expertise and broad experience of its members. CHIPS Alliance encourages contributions and shared investments by providing vendor-neutral promotional events, documentation, tools and support for a variety of projects in our workgroups.

Rob Mains serves as General Manager of the CHIPS Alliance. Rob joined the organization in January 2021, bringing more than 38 years of industry experience to the role. To learn more about Rob, please visit [here](https://chipsalliance.org/about/governance/). 


## Current Workgroups

The following workgroups are part of CHIPS Alliance:

- **Interconnect** (currently OmniXtend, the AIB chiplet interface and TileLink)
- **Cores** (including the SWeRV core family)
- **Tools** (grouping efforts around extending Verilator to allow UVM-based DV, SystemVerilog support in open source, the RISC-V DV framework as well as tools like Cocotb and FuseSoC)
- **Chisel** (concerning the development of the Chisel HDL, FIRRTL intermediate representation and related tools)
- **Rocket SoC** (encompassing the Rocket core generator ecosystem)

The organization is also working on setting up an Open Source Analog Design/Generators Working Group.


## Growing Membership

In March 2019, CHIPS Alliance was formed as a project under the Linux Foundation. The four founding members – Esperanto, Google, SiFive and Western Digital – set the aspirations for the group. CHIPS Alliance can be viewed as an extension of the mission started by organizations such as RISC-V International. RISC-V defines an open instruction set architecture (ISA) specification which paved the way for a plethora of open cores and CPU implementations, but does not instruct how to make the physical hardware and other building blocks needed to create practical open silicon. This is where CHIPS Alliance begins. Using open standards such as RISC-V, CHIPS Alliance is working to collaboratively build robust and industry-proven cores, peripherals and SoCs. 

Early on it became clear that lowering the barriers and cost of development would require collaboration among many parties to develop relevant open source design tools. CHIPS Alliance stepped up to the task. Today the organization focuses on both open source hardware RTL designs and open source software and hardware design tool development. CHIPS Alliance is a barrier free, open organization promoting open silicon.

CHIPS Alliance has grown to more than 25 members over the past year. The organization now boasts some of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers including Intel, Samsung, Futurewei and Alibaba. Software tools, IP and services companies in the organization include Antmicro, Codasip, Imperas, Qamcom and Verisilicon. Several notable universities and open source projects are also part of CHIPS Alliance such as UC Berkeley, IIT Madras, Yale University, OpenRoad, Munich University of Applied Sciences and UC San Diego. The complete membership list can be found at https://chipsalliance.org/about/members/

- The Chisel workgroup has also achieved a significant number of technical milestones, as presented on the [2020 Chisel Community Conference](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/chisel-community-conference/program/schedule/)

## Why Members Join CHIPS Alliance

The members of CHIPS Alliance join for a variety of reasons. Some organizations join to grow their business. Companies that fall into this group normally offer an open source solution, along with selling support and additional services to interested companies. As an example, Codasip has an open [SweRV package](https://codasip.com/swerv/#action) that anyone can access, a Pro version with commercial EDA tools, and customization and verification services available upon request.

Many organizations join CHIPS Alliance to accelerate development of a RTL IP/SoC or software tool. For example, the software tool Verilator and the hardware compiler framework Chisel have benefited from their organizations joining. See slide 4 of the [Verilator, Accelerated](https://www.veripool.org/papers/Verilator_Accelerated_OSDA2020.pdf) presentation to see how CHIPS Alliance has benefited the Verilator ecosystem.

Another reason companies join CHIPS Alliance is to accelerate adoption of IP or software. One such IP is AIB which was brought into CHIPS Alliance by Intel. AIB is a chiplet interconnect and is being adopted by a number of companies. [DARPA presented](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2020-03-25) on the benefits of AIB and how chiplets can accelerate SoC development.
