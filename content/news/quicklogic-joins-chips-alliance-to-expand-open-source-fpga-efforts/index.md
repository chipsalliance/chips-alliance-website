**SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 11, 2020** – CHIPS Alliance, the leading consortium advancing common and open hardware for interfaces, processors and systems, today announced that QuickLogic Corporation (NASDAQ: QUIK), a developer of ultra-low power multi-core voice-enabled SoCs, embedded FPGA IP, and Endpoint AI solutions, has joined as its newest member.

“Over the past few years the electronics industry has seen a big shift towards open source hardware and software, and we’re proud to be one of the companies at the forefront of that movement,” said Brian Faith, president and CEO at QuickLogic. “We have already been working closely with several CHIPS Alliance members to make FPGA tools and devices more accessible, and we look forward to continuing these efforts as an official member of the organization.”

QuickLogic recently announced the [QuickLogic Open Reconfigurable Computing (QORC)](https://www.quicklogic.com/QORC/) initiative to broaden access to open FPGA technology for embedded systems developers. QuickLogic’s initial open source development tools, developed in collaboration with CHIPS Alliance members Antmicro and Google, include complete support for QuickLogic’s EOS S3 low power voice and sensor processing MCU with an integrated embedded FPGA (eFPGA), and its PolarPro 3E discrete FPGA family. 

Additionally, QuickLogic and Antmicro launched the first fully open source ArmⓇ CortexⓇ M4 MCU + eFPGA SoC dev kit, [QuickFeather™](https://www.quicklogic.com/products/eos-s3/quickfeather-development-kit/). Antmicro added support for the QuickFeather dev kit into the Zephyr Real Time Operating System (RTOS), as well as in its open source Renode simulation framework. This small form factor development board is ideal for low-power machine learning (ML) capable IoT devices.

Said Dr. Zvonimir Bandić, Chairman, CHIPS Alliance: “The CHIPS Alliance is continuing to focus on expanding its member base with organizations from a diverse set of industries. QuickLogic, a leader in open source eFPGA IP and FPGA tooling, will help us drive innovation in the FPGA sector and further our mission to remove barriers for open hardware design.”

QuickLogic’s Brian Faith will present “Open Source FPGA Tooling, Our Journey from Resistance to Adoption” at the CHIPS Alliance Workshop, being held virtually on Thursday, September 17.

## About the CHIPS Alliance

The CHIPS Alliance is an organization which develops and hosts high-quality, open source hardware code (IP cores), interconnect IP (physical and logical protocols), and open source software development tools for design, verification, and more. The main aim is to provide a barrier-free collaborative environment, to lower the cost of developing IP and tools for hardware development. The CHIPS Alliance is hosted by the Linux Foundation.
