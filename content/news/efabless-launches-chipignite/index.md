- Program includes a pre-designed carrier chip and automated open source design flow from Efabless
- SkyWater’s open source SKY130 process is the first node to be used to fabricate chips for the program
- Initiative removes access barriers by significantly reducing cost and the need for deep semiconductor experience to design chips

[Efabless](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_QfpiutgK9BkRkwqOZ_QgaW-wScChSfzrLoisG3jrx29CaZIKTRoBuySTDuHXJZP0EbK1_N1KyzIRCW2sFc5NA==), a community chip creation platform, today announced the launch of its new chipIgnite program to bring chip design and fabrication to the masses and a collaboration with [SkyWater Technology](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=P477GUgP-WxQLcA8zmSX8V24RDJ0fqqGp8teNuFfFkL7nLvoEPgkh9Uyo0a6ZDG-JNw_Hz99p5lNq7zs7gL_EsV6v-ZGI8zuNwlyMu1wbZ4=) for the first node supported in the program. The chipIgnite program expands upon the SKY130-based open source chip manufacturing program sponsored by Google and supports private commercial designs that include non-open source IP. This initiative represents another step forward in the industry to broaden access to chip design by giving people the ability to more easily create and fabricate chips.

The first shuttle in the chipIgnite program will support fabrication of student projects as part of the EE272B course in the Electrical Engineering department at Stanford University for senior undergraduate and graduate students.

The new program also has industry support from organizations including QuickLogic and the CHIPS Alliance.

“CHIPS Alliance is a major champion of open source hardware design and associated design automation tools. I am excited to see the chipIgnite program offered by Efabless to include many different collaborative IP developers to prove new ideas. The platform alleviates the barriers to entry into chip design and allows for ready exploration of many concepts,” said Rob Mains, general manager of CHIPS Alliance.
