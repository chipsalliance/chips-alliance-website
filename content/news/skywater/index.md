It’s great to learn that Google [announced](https://www.skywatertechnology.com/skywater-receives-funding-from-dod-partners-with-google-to-facilitate-open-source-design-for-its-new-90-nm-technology-offering/) the expansion of its partnership with [SkyWater Technology](https://www.skywatertechnology.com/). They are working together to release an open source process design kit (PDK) for SKY90-FD, SkyWater’s commercial 90nm fully depleted silicon on insulator (FDSOI) CMOS process technology. SKY90-FD is based on MIT Lincoln Laboratory’s 90 nm commercial FDSOI technology, and enables designers to create complex integrated circuits for a diverse range of applications.
