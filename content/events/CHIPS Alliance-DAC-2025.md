CHIPS Alliance is pleased to participate in the 62nd Design Automation Conference (DAC), taking place June 22–25, 2025, at the Moscone Center West in San Francisco. DAC is a key industry gathering for the semiconductor and electronic design automation (EDA) community, with a growing focus on open source contributions to chip and system design.
Don’t miss CHIPS Alliance Executive Director Rob Mains presenting:

Session: The Evolution of Collaborative Open Source Hardware Development
Date/Time: Wednesday, June 25 | 10:30am – 12:00pm PDT
Location: Room 2012, Level 2
Track: Engineering Special Session – Systems and Software

Rob will explore how open source silicon initiatives—such as Caliptra, Chisel, and collaborative firmware efforts—are transforming the way companies, universities, and individuals contribute to the development of secure and scalable hardware platforms. The session will highlight practical strategies for ecosystem collaboration, integration into design flows, and opportunities for new contributors.

We invite attendees to connect with CHIPS Alliance representatives during the conference to learn how to get involved in current projects and shape the future of open source hardware design.
