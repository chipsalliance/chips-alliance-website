   The CHIPS Alliance is a directed fund of [The Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org/), a 501(c)(6) non-profit organization. Following best practices in the industry, we maintain a clear and consistent separation of responsibilities between technical and non-technical governance decisions. The CHIPS Alliance operates under its Charter.

In addition to the top-level structure of The CHIPS Alliance, each hosted open source project has its own process, structure, and community. While the Technical Advisory Council (TAC) sets high-level technical policy, projects have a great deal of flexibility in day-to-day operations, and would typically each adopt their own [technical charter based on a common template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_NeUOrl8IG7ih-Ji31LehKqv0KGT3VJcotvv4SwBmIg/edit).

## Governing Board

## Technical Advisory Council (TAC)

The role of the Technical Advisory Council, or TAC, is to facilitate communication and collaboration among the CHIPS Alliance Technical Projects. The TAC is responsible for implementing technical policy and procedures within the scope and direction of the policies set by the Governing Board, such as defining and maintaining neutral consensus on the technical vision for CHIPS Alliance projects, shepherding projects through their technical lifecycle, and identifying, recruiting, and engaging prospective projects.

The TAC operates openly and transparently, the voting members of the TAC consist of one representative appointed by each Platinum Member and one representative appointed by the technical oversight body (e.g., a technical steering committee) of each TAC Project. TAC meetings are open to all, and both members and non-members may participate.
