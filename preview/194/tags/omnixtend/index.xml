In case you missed the talks, a replay is available on the CHIPS Alliance YouTube channel.
During the seminar, we had eight exciting technical presentations, including:
Porting Android to RISC-V – Guoyin Chen and Han Mao, Alibaba Practical Adoption of Open Source SystemVerilog Tools – Michael Gielda, Antmicro Chisel and FIRRTL for Next-Generation SoC Designs – Jack Koenig, SiFive OpenFASOC: Automated Open Source Analog and Mixed-Signals IC Generation – Mehdi Saligane, University of Michigan (UMICH) FPGA Tooling Interoperability with the FPGA Interchange Format – Maciej Kurc, Antmicro OmniXtend: Scalability and LPC – Jaco Hofmann, Western Digital Corporation Open Source NVME IP with AI Acceleration – Anand Kulkarni, Western Digital Corporation and Karol Gugala, Antmicro Automating Analog Layout using ALIGN – Sachin Sapatnekar, University of Minnesota (UMN) Each of these talks provided informative, technical details of key aspects of the work underway by members of CHIPS Alliance who are working in an open, collaborative fashion.</description></item><item><title>CHIPS Alliance and RISC-V International Invite the RISC-V Community to Participate in Updating a New Unified Memory Architecture Standard</title><link>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/194/news/risc-v-international-omnixtend-working-group/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/194/news/risc-v-international-omnixtend-working-group/</guid><description>New joint working group will enhance the OmniXtend Cache Coherency architecture
SAN FRANCISCO, March 24, 2020 – RISC-V International, a non-profit corporation controlled by its members to drive the adoption and implementation of the free and open RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA), and CHIPS Alliance, the leading consortium advancing common and open hardware for interfaces, processors and systems, today announced a joint collaboration to update the OmniXtend Cache Coherency specification and protocol, along with building out developer tools for OmniXtend.</description></item><item><title>CHIPS Alliance to Collaborate with RISC-V to Standardize an Open Unified Memory Leveraging OmniXtend</title><link>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/194/news/omnixtend/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/194/news/omnixtend/</guid><description>CHIPS Alliance to highlight OmniXtend advances at RISC-V Summit
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 8, 2020 – CHIPS Alliance, the leading consortium advancing common and open hardware for interfaces, processors and systems, today announced that the organization will highlight OmniXtend advances in a presentation at the RISC-V Summit, taking place virtually from Dec. 8-10, 2020. The CHIPS Alliance plans to work with RISC-V International to standardize an open unified memory coherency bus leveraging OmniXtend to foster innovation for data-centric applications.</description></item></channel></rss>
