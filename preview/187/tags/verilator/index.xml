This allows verification tests to run shorter by focusing the validation of the design’s behavior on input that the designer considers useful and interesting.
A few months ago Antmicro introduced constrained randomization to Verilator - another significant milestone on the way towards full open source support for SystemVerilog and industry-prevalent UVM testbenches.</description></item><item><title>Initial assertion control support in Verilator</title><link>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/187/news/initial-assertion-control-support-in-verilator/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/187/news/initial-assertion-control-support-in-verilator/</guid><description>Antmicro is continuously working on improving productivity of ASIC design and verification workflows using open source tools as leaders of the CHIPS Alliance Tools Workgroup, as well as for customer and R&amp;amp;D projects. Extending Verilator with new verification features is a prominent example of such efforts, with the latest notable improvements including initial support for UVM testbenches, the astsee tool for Verilator process and AST analysis and constrained randomization.
In this article, Antmicro introduces initial support for global assertion control (already part of mainline Verilator), building on existing support for assertions available in the simulator.</description></item><item><title>Analyze Verilator processes and ASTs with the astsee suite</title><link>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/187/news/analyze-verilator-processes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/187/news/analyze-verilator-processes/</guid><description>Among other things, Antmicro’s work towards improving the vertical integration potential of customers designing ASIC solutions often sees them enhance one of the flagship open source projects in this space, Verilator which complements - and in fact is often used alongside - Antmicro’s own functional simulation framework, Renode.

It is commonly used for simulation and testing, but originally, due to the lack of capability to run event-driven simulations, Verilator wasn’t even considered capable of handling UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) testbenches implemented in SystemVerilog which require scheduling and other features notably absent from the tool. For some time now, Antmicro, together with Western Digital, Google and others in the CHIPS Alliance, has been working on enabling fully open source support for SystemVerilog UVM testbenches in Verilator.</description></item><item><title>Towards UVM: Using Coroutines for Low-overhead Dynamic Scheduling in Verilator</title><link>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/187/news/towards-uvm-using-coroutines/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/187/news/towards-uvm-using-coroutines/</guid><description>This post was originally published at Antmicro.
Verilator is a popular open source SystemVerilog simulator and one of the key tools in the ASIC and FPGA ecosystem, which Antmicro is actively using and developing, e.g. by enabling co-simulation with Renode or Cocotb integration. It’s also one of the fastest available HDL simulators, including proprietary alternatives. It achieves that speed by generating highly optimized C++ code from a given hardware design. Verilator does a lot of work at compile-time to make the generated (‘verilated’) code extremely fast, such as ordering statements in an optimal way.</description></item><item><title>Listen to CHIPS Alliance’s Rob Mains on EE Journal’s FishFry Podcast</title><link>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/187/news/listen-to-chips-alliances-rob-mains-on-ee-journals-fishfry-podcast/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/187/news/listen-to-chips-alliances-rob-mains-on-ee-journals-fishfry-podcast/</guid><description>CHIPS Alliance’s general manager Rob Mains joined Amelia Dalton at EE Journal’s FishFry podcast for a lively discussion about how we’re working to make chip design more accessible.

Co-simulating HDL has been possible in Renode since the 1.7.1 release, but the functionality – critical for hardware/software co-development as well as FPGA use cases – is constantly evolving based on the needs of our customers like Google and Microchip as well as our work in open source groups including CHIPS Alliance and RISC-V International. To quickly recap, by co-simulation we mean a scenario where a part of the system is simulated in Renode but some specific peripheral or subsystem is simulated directly from HDL, e.</description></item><item><title>Progress on Building Open Source Infrastructure for System Verilog</title><link>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/187/news/open-source-infrastructure-for-system-verilog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/187/news/open-source-infrastructure-for-system-verilog/</guid><description>SystemVerilog is a rich hardware design description and verification language that is seeing increased usage in industry.

The ASIC development community has widely embraced Verilator as an effective, often even superior alternative to proprietary solutions, and it is now the standard approach in RISC-V CPU design as the community has worked to provide Verilator simulation capabilities out of the box. CHIPS Alliance and RISC-V leaders Antmicro and Western Digital have been collaborating to make Verilator even more useful for ASIC design purposes, working towards supporting industry-standard verification methods in a completely open source flow.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Scheduling in Verilator – Milestone Towards Open Source UVM</title><link>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/187/news/dynamic-scheduling-in-verilator/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/187/news/dynamic-scheduling-in-verilator/</guid><description>This post was originally published at Antmicro.
UVM is a verification methodology traditionally used in chip design which has historically been missing from the open source landscape of verification-focused tooling. While new, open source approaches to verification have emerged that include the excellent Python-based Cocotb (that we also use and support) maintained by FOSSi Foundation, not everyone can easily adopt it, especially in long-running projects and existing codebases that use a different verification approach.</description></item><item><title>Goings-on in the FuseSoC Project and Other Open Source Silicon Related News</title><link>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/187/news/goings-on-in-the-fusesoc-project-and-other-open-source-silicon-related-news/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/187/news/goings-on-in-the-fusesoc-project-and-other-open-source-silicon-related-news/</guid><description>This post was originally published by Olof Kindgren
FOSSi Fever 2020 2020 was a year with a lot of bad news and so it feels slightly strange to cheerfully write about a very specific topic in the light of this. But there will always be good and bad things happening in the world. So let’s keep fighting the bad things and for now take look at what happened last year within the amazing world of open source silicon.</description></item><item><title>Enabling Open Source Ibex Synthesis and Simulation in Verilator/Yosys via UHDM/Surelog</title><link>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/187/news/ibex-synthesis-and-simulation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/187/news/ibex-synthesis-and-simulation/</guid><description>This post was originally published at Antmicro.
Throughout 2020 we were hard at work developing proper, portable SystemVerilog support for multiple open-source FPGA and ASIC design tools used by us and our customers, most notably Yosys and Verilator. We strongly believe that the support is a necessary step in building a collaborative ecosystem and scalable and reproducible CIs, especially publicly accessible ones that are common in multi-organization projects such as OpenTitan and CHIPS Alliance.</description></item><item><title>CHIPS SweRV Cores and the Open Tools Ecosystem</title><link>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/187/news/chips-swerv-cores-and-the-open-tools-ecosystem/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/187/news/chips-swerv-cores-and-the-open-tools-ecosystem/</guid><description>This post was originally published at Antmicro.
