This opportunity comes after the success of having 40 submissions for the MPW-ONE shuttle; 60% of those designs were submitted by first-time ASIC designers. &lt;a href="https://efabless.com/open_shuttle_program/2">MPW-TWO&lt;/a> is the second Open MPW Shuttle providing fabrication for fully open-source projects using the SkyWater Open Source PDK announced by Google and SkyWater.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
