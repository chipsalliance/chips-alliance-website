Rob discussed CHIPS Alliance’s work with RISC-V International to develop a new unified memory standard, along with our work to accelerate the design of open source chipsets with the AIB 2.0 specification. The conversation also touched on our efforts to provide better support for SystemVerilog using open source tools and to create a dynamic stratified scheduler implementation in Verilator.</description></item><item><title>A Look Back at the CHIPS Alliance’s Incredible Growth</title><link>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/191/news/chips-alliances-incredible-growth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/191/news/chips-alliances-incredible-growth/</guid><description>It’s been just over a year since the CHIPS Alliance was founded with the mission of making open source hardware development more accessible to companies, universities and individuals. We’re working to bring the dynamics of the hugely successful open source software development model into ASIC design, building on the groundwork set by the RISC-V community. Progress over the past year is detailed in our Annual Report.
CHIPS Alliance is focused on expanding on this open hardware vision by:</description></item></channel></rss>
