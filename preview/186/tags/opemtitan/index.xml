Extending Verilator with new verification features is a prominent example of such efforts, with the latest notable improvements including initial support for UVM testbenches, the astsee tool for Verilator process and AST analysis and constrained randomization.
In this article, Antmicro introduces initial support for global assertion control (already part of mainline Verilator), building on existing support for assertions available in the simulator.</description></item><item><title>Improving the OpenLane ASIC Build Flow with Open Source SystemVerilog Support</title><link>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/186/news/improving-the-openlane-asic-build-flow-with-open-source-systemverilog-support/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/186/news/improving-the-openlane-asic-build-flow-with-open-source-systemverilog-support/</guid><description>This post was originally published at Antmicro.
Open source toolchains are key to building collaborative ecosystems, welcoming to new approaches, opportunistic/focused innovations and niche use cases. The ASIC design domain, especially in the view of the rising tensions around manufacturing and supply chains, are in dire need of a software-driven innovation based on an open source approach. The fledgling open source hardware ecosystem has been energized by the success of RISC-V and is now being vastly expanded to cover the entire ASIC design flow by CHIPS Alliance, and Antmicro has been playing a leadership role in both of these organizations as well as offering commercial engineering and support services to assist with early adoption of open source approaches in hardware.</description></item></channel></rss>
