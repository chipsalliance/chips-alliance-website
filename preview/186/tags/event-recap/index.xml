The chip placement problem is a notoriously challenging design problem, and has been explored in the electronic design automation research and development community for years. For those unfamiliar with the problem, it involves finding the optimal placement of physical cells implementing the logical function on a chip image to minimize performance, power, and area of the silicon, which in the end affects the cost of the product.</description></item><item><title>Recap of the Fall 2021 CHIPS Alliance Workshop</title><link>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/186/news/recap-of-the-fall-2021-chips-alliance-workshop-rob-mains-chips-alliance/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsalliance.org/preview/186/news/recap-of-the-fall-2021-chips-alliance-workshop-rob-mains-chips-alliance/</guid><description>We recently held our fall 2021 CHIPS Alliance workshop with nearly 160 attendees present for informative seminars covering a range of topics including porting Android to RISC-V, open source ASIC design and FPGA tooling, and OmniXtend. In case you missed the talks, a replay is available on the CHIPS Alliance YouTube channel.
During the seminar, we had eight exciting technical presentations, including:
Porting Android to RISC-V – Guoyin Chen and Han Mao, Alibaba Practical Adoption of Open Source SystemVerilog Tools – Michael Gielda, Antmicro Chisel and FIRRTL for Next-Generation SoC Designs – Jack Koenig, SiFive OpenFASOC: Automated Open Source Analog and Mixed-Signals IC Generation – Mehdi Saligane, University of Michigan (UMICH) FPGA Tooling Interoperability with the FPGA Interchange Format – Maciej Kurc, Antmicro OmniXtend: Scalability and LPC – Jaco Hofmann, Western Digital Corporation Open Source NVME IP with AI Acceleration – Anand Kulkarni, Western Digital Corporation and Karol Gugala, Antmicro Automating Analog Layout using ALIGN – Sachin Sapatnekar, University of Minnesota (UMN) Each of these talks provided informative, technical details of key aspects of the work underway by members of CHIPS Alliance who are working in an open, collaborative fashion.</description></item></channel></rss>
