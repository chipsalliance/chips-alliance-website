<div><p>CHIPS Alliance was founded in March 2019 to design high-quality, open source hardware register transfer level (RTL) and develop open source hardware and software design tools. By creating an open and collaborative environment, companies and organizations can develop innovative, cost effective hardware designs optimized for the requirements of today’s silicon devices and FPGAs.</p>
<p>CHIPS Alliance was incorporated by four organizations which wanted to make open source silicon a reality. Esperanto, Google, SiFive and Western Digital were the founding members. Now that one year has passed since the organization’s founding, it is fitting to look back at our progress so far. We are pleased to present this annual report detailing the many things we have accomplished collectively in this fast growing organization.</p>
<p>Comments and feedback are welcome at <a href=mailto:info@chipsalliance.org>info@chipsalliance.org</a>.</p>
<p>“The growth behind CHIPS Alliance has been incredible. We are laying the foundation for open source hardware development to become accessible to a wider number of companies, universities and individuals.”<br>
– Zvonimir Bandic, Governing Board Chair, CHIPS Alliance, and Senior Director, Western Digital</p>

<h2 id=growing-membership>Growing Membership</h2>
<p>In March 2019, CHIPS Alliance was formed as a project under the Linux Foundation. The four founding members – Esperanto, Google, SiFive and Western Digital – set the aspirations for the group. CHIPS Alliance can be viewed as an extension of the mission started by organizations such as RISC-V International. RISC-V defines an open instruction set architecture (ISA) specification which paved the way for a plethora of open cores and CPU implementations, but does not instruct how to make the physical hardware and other building blocks needed to create practical open silicon. This is where CHIPS Alliance begins. Using open standards such as RISC-V, CHIPS Alliance is working to collaboratively build robust and industry-proven cores, peripherals and SoCs.</p>
<p>Early on it became clear that lowering the barriers and cost of development would require collaboration among many parties to develop relevant open source design tools. CHIPS Alliance stepped up to the task. Today the organization focuses on both open source hardware RTL designs and open source software and hardware design tool development. CHIPS Alliance is a barrier free, open organization promoting open silicon.</p>
<p>CHIPS Alliance has grown to nineteen members over the past year. The organization now boasts some of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers including Intel, Samsung, Futurewei and Alibaba. Software tools, IP and services companies in the organization include Antmicro, Codasip, Imperas and Qamcom. Several notable universities and open source projects are also part of CHIPS Alliance, including the leading open simulator tool Verilator, UC Berkeley, IIT Madras, Yale University, OpenRoad, Munich University of Applied Sciences and UC San Diego. The complete membership list can be found at <a href=https://chipsalliance.org/>https://chipsalliance.org/</a>.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-get-involved>How Do I Get Involved?</h2>
<p>To aid new members and those who are interested in knowing more about CHIPS Alliance, we have created a <a href=https://github.com/chipsalliance/foundation>Getting Started Guide</a>. We encourage everyone to join our main <a href=https://github.com/chipsalliance/foundation/blob/master/tutorials/GROUPS.IO.md>mailing list</a>, follow us on social media channels <a href=https://twitter.com/chipsalliance>Twitter</a> and <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/company/chipsalliance/>LinkedIn</a>, and engage in our technical community, which is not limited to members. If you see a particular workgroup you want to get involved in, you can join that specific mailing list and attend their meetings.</p>
<h2 id=events-over-the-past-year>Events Over The Past Year</h2>
<p>After the formation of CHIPS Alliance, we began holding events to share what the organization is about and to highlight progress of various work groups. Listed chronologically:</p>
<ul>
<li>It started with our <a href=https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/chips-alliance-workshop-2019/program/schedule/>inaugural workshop</a> held in June 2019 at Google’s Sunnyvale campus.

<li>Western Digital <a href=https://blog.westerndigital.com/omnixtend-fabric-innovation-with-risc-v/>open sourced</a> the OmniXtend™ cache-coherent protocol to provide an efficient way to attach persistent memory processors. Learn more at <a href=https://github.com/chipsalliance/omnixtend>GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>Google released RISCV-DV – a SystemVerilog/UVM based open-source instruction generator for RISC-V processor verification. The project is available on <a href=https://github.com/google/riscv-dv>GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>The Cores and Tools workgroups created a portable SoC based on the SweRV CoreTM EH1 using FuseSoC; the SoC includes a debug port and Zephyr support.</li>
<li>The Chisel workgroup has also achieved a significant number of technical milestones, as presented on the <a href=https://events.linuxfoundation.org/chisel-community-conference/program/schedule/>2020 Chisel Community Conference</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id=why-members-join-chips-alliance>Why Members Join Chips Alliance</h2>
<p>The members of CHIPS Alliance join for a variety of reasons. Some organizations join to grow their business. Companies that fall into this group normally offer an open source solution, along with selling support and additional services to interested companies. As an example, Codasip has an open <a href=https://codasip.com/swerv/#action>SweRV package</a> that anyone can access, a Pro version with commercial EDA tools, and customization and verification services available upon request.</p>
<p>Many organizations join CHIPS Alliance to accelerate development of a RTL IP/SoC or software tool. For example, Verilator and Chisel are software development tools that have benefited from their organizations joining. See slide 4 of the <a href=https://www.veripool.org/papers/Verilator_Accelerated_OSDA2020.pdf>Verilator, Accelerated</a> presentation to see how CHIPS Alliance has benefited the Verilator ecosystem.</p>
<p>Another reason companies join CHIPS Alliance is to accelerate adoption of IP or software. One such IP is AIB which was brought into CHIPS Alliance by Intel. AIB is a chiplet interconnect and is being adopted by a number of companies. Recently <a href=https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2020-03-25>DARPA presented</a> on the benefits of AIB and how chiplets can accelerate SoC development.</p>

<h2 id=a-look-ahead-to-2021>A Look Ahead To 2021</h2>
<p>While CHIPS Alliance had a number of in-person events planned for 2020, many of these events have been delayed or postponed due to COVID-19. In the meantime, the CHIPS Alliance will be hosting several online events and meetups. Sign up for our <a href=https://lists.chipsalliance.org/g/announce>announcements list</a> to be kept up-to-date on our events.</p>
<p>The CHIPS Alliance has seen additional interest from a number of companies, organizations and nonprofits in joining our ecosystem, so we will continue to focus on growing our membership. As development accelerates and more output is generated, we anticipate this will foster even more interest in CHIPS Alliance and its open source solutions.</p>
<p>Lastly, we are actively recruiting a full time executive director and hope to have this individual on board by mid-2020.</p>
