&lt;p>Open source hardware is undeniably undergoing a renaissance whose origin can be traced to the establishment of RISC-V Foundation (later redubbed RISC-V International). The open ISA and ecosystem, in which Antmicro participated since the beginning as a Founding member, has sparked many open source CPU implementations but also new tooling, methodologies and trends which allow for more collaborative and software driven design.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many of those broader open hardware activities have been finding a home in &lt;a href="https://chipsalliance.org/">CHIPS Alliance&lt;/a>, an open source organization we participate in as a Platinum member alongside Google, Intel, Western Digital, SiFive and others, whose goals explicitly encompass:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
