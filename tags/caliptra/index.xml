This is true both for executable code and digital design, but the different nature of RTL and software execution requires developers to look at different types of coverage information. On top of tracking executed code lines and visited branches, RTL coverage will also need to include information e.</description></item><item><title>Constrained randomization in Verilator</title><link>https://chipsalliance.org/news/constrained-randomization-verilator/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsalliance.org/news/constrained-randomization-verilator/</guid><description>Digital design verification often utilizes the so-called constrained randomization functionality offered by SystemVerilog, where in order to efficiently test designs with random but still correct data, a digital logic designer can put constraints in place. This allows verification tests to run shorter by focusing the validation of the design’s behavior on input that the designer considers useful and interesting.
A few months ago Antmicro introduced constrained randomization to Verilator - another significant milestone on the way towards full open source support for SystemVerilog and industry-prevalent UVM testbenches.</description></item><item><title>Caliptra - Support for VeeR EL2 with User Mode and Physical Memory Protection in Tock embedded OS</title><link>https://chipsalliance.org/news/caliptra-support-for-veer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsalliance.org/news/caliptra-support-for-veer/</guid><description>The Caliptra Root of Trust project, a collaboration between AMD, Google, Microsoft and NVIDIA within the CHIPS Alliance, is steadily heading towards its 2.0 release – an effort Antmicro is actively contributing to. They’ve recently described their implementation of User mode in the RISC-V VeeR EL2 core along with extended Physical Memory Protection, and related to this work, they’ve introduced support for VeeR EL2 with User Mode and PMP to the Tock embedded OS.</description></item><item><title>Caliptra @ OCP Global Summit 2024</title><link>https://chipsalliance.org/news/caliptra-ocp-global-summit-2024/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsalliance.org/news/caliptra-ocp-global-summit-2024/</guid><description>Introduction As we continue to advance the field of hardware security, we are thrilled to celebrate the successful integration of Caliptra 1.x by our esteemed partners. Their commitment to enhancing security through the adoption of our open-source Root of Trust (RoT) is a testament to the collaborative spirit of the Open Compute Project (OCP). In this post, we also look ahead to the exciting developments planned for Caliptra 2.0.
