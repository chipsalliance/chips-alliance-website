&lt;p>Caliptra is a new specification for an open source silicon root of trust (RoT) designed to meet the enhanced security requirements of modern edge and confidential computing workloads. CHIPS Alliance will oversee the open source implementation of register-transfer level (RTL) code for Caliptra that can be synthesized into current SoC designs, along with the verification suite and firmware. As part of this architecture, the open source RISC-V core hosted by the CHIPS Alliance and now relaunched as VeeR, is embedded within the Caliptra Root of Trust macro. VeeR is a true open source RISC-V core family with full RTL and verification bench all under Apache 2.0 license ready for anyone to use.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Joint Analog Workgroup / MOS-AK Panel Session</title><link>https://chipsalliance.org/news/joint-analog-workgroup-mos-ak-panel-session/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsalliance.org/news/joint-analog-workgroup-mos-ak-panel-session/</guid><description>&lt;p>Please join us for a special joint panel webinar session for the CHIPS Alliance Analog Workgroup and MOS-AK Foundation.&lt;/p>
